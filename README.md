All solutions are presented as part of training me as an IOS developer. Made in the Swift language on the Xcode platform.

> Note that Xcode [Version 14.0](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). 
And Swift [Version 5.7](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/Compatibility.html).
> I think that's all you need to know to run these programs.
